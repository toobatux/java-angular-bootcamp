# Exercise 2 — Fill Dockerfile TODO Skeleton

## Activity card

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Time** | 12–15 minutes |
| **Checkpoint** | **B** (after slides 46–49) |
| **Deliverable** | `notes/lab41-dockerfile-todos.md` |
| **Fixtures** | Synthetic CUS-1001 smoke · no secrets in notes |

### What you will learn

Fill FROM/COPY/USER/HEALTHCHECK TODOs for crm-api:lab41.

### Enterprise context

Pom-first COPY order keeps layer cache warm.

### Predict

Jar not found after build — usual cause?

### Debug

Permission denied as non-root — chown missing?

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Wrong jar glob | Match spring-boot repackaged jar name |
| ARG password | Forbidden — inject at run time |

## Files to create (practice — commit to GitHub)

This exercise is **practice only**. Commit the file(s) below to your GitHub repo. Nothing is submitted or graded.

| Item | Path (under `examples/module-41-exercises/`) |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Your notes file | `notes/lab41-dockerfile-todos.md` |

## Worked example (read first)

Here is the shape of a complete answer for this exercise. Adapt the content — do not leave blanks.

```markdown
# Lab 41 — Fill Dockerfile TODO Skeleton

## Step 1 — Skeleton

Create `Dockerfile.skeleton` notes:
```

Then follow **Steps** to create your own file.

## Steps

### Step 1 — Create the notes file

From `examples/module-41-exercises/`, create `notes/` if needed, then create `notes/lab41-dockerfile-todos.md`.

### Step 2 — Paste and complete this template

```markdown
# Lab 41 — Fill Dockerfile TODO Skeleton

## Step 1 — Skeleton

Create `Dockerfile.skeleton` notes:
```
FROM _____ AS build
WORKDIR /workspace
COPY _____ .
RUN ./mvnw -B -DskipTests package
FROM _____ AS runtime
USER _____
COPY --from=build _____ /app/app.jar
HEALTHCHECK CMD _____
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","/app/app.jar"]
```

## Step 2 — Fill blanks

Fill JDK/JRE image tags, copy paths, USER, and HEALTHCHECK using course conventions.

## Step 3 — Peer check

Mark any blank you are unsure about for Lab 41 confirmation.

## Step 4 — Security scrub

Confirm no secret ARG/ENV slipped in.

## Scope
Pre-lab only — do not finish the full lab in this exercise.
```

### Step 3 — Self-check

Confirm fixtures if used: Amina `CUS-1001`/`ACTIVE`, Ravi `CUS-1002`/`PROSPECT`, correlation `lab-request-001`. Replace every `_____` before Pass.

## Expected result

A filled Dockerfile skeleton ready for Lab 41 verification in `notes/lab41-dockerfile-todos.md`.

## If it fails

| Problem | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| No file / wrong name | Must be `notes/lab41-dockerfile-todos.md` |
| Leaving blanks or skipping steps | Complete every step before claiming Pass |
| Starting the full lab mid-exercise | Finish pre-lab notes first, then open Lab 41 |

## Pass criteria

_Check **Pass** or **Fail** yourself. Do not write these marks anywhere — nothing is submitted or graded. Commit your work to your GitHub repo._

Self-check before marking Pass:

- [ ] File exists at `notes/lab41-dockerfile-todos.md`
- [ ] All major blanks filled or marked unsure
- [ ] Non-root USER set
- [ ] No secrets present
